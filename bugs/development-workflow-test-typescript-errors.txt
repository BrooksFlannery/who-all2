# Problem
The development workflow test file (`tests/test-development-workflow.test.ts`) has several TypeScript errors that prevent it from compiling:

1. Line 51: `setTimeout` usage issue - Argument of type '(value: unknown) => void' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'
2. Line 533: Variable naming conflict with global `process` object
3. Line 536: Block-scoped variable 'process' used before its declaration
4. Line 540: Parameter 'data' implicitly has an 'any' type

# Affected Systems
- `tests/test-development-workflow.test.ts` - Development workflow test suite
- TypeScript compilation process
- Test runner (vitest)

# Root Cause
1. The `setTimeout` function from `timers/promises` is being used incorrectly - it should be awaited directly, not used with `.then()`
2. Variable naming conflicts with the global `process` object in Node.js
3. Missing type annotations for event handler parameters

# Solution
1. Fix `setTimeout` usage by awaiting it directly instead of using `.then()`
2. Rename all local variables that conflict with global `process` to `childProcess`
3. Add proper type annotations for all event handler parameters
4. Import the correct `setTimeout` function or use the global one properly

# Debugging Process
1. Created comprehensive development workflow test suite for Phase 7
2. Encountered TypeScript compilation errors during development
3. Attempted to fix variable naming conflicts by renaming `process` to `childProcess`
4. Fixed some type annotations for event handlers
5. Reached 3-attempt limit for linter error fixes
6. Identified remaining issues:
   - Incorrect `setTimeout` usage pattern
   - Remaining variable naming conflicts
   - Missing type annotations
