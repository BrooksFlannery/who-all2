# Database Initialization Required for Auth/Socket

## Problem

- The app, server, or tests fail with errors about missing or undefined database connection.
- This happens when `initializeDatabase()` is not called before using the DB, or when tests do not mock it.

## Symptoms

- "Failed to initialize database for authentication"
- "db is undefined" or similar errors in logs/tests
- Flaky or failing socket/auth tests

## Solution

- Always call `initializeDatabase()` before using the DB in production/dev code.
- In tests, always mock both `db` and `initializeDatabase` in the test setup.
- If you add new scripts or move code, check that DB initialization is handled.

## Example (test setup):

```ts
vi.mock('@/lib/db', () => ({
    db: { /* ...mocked methods... */ },
    initializeDatabase: vi.fn(() => ({ /* ...mocked methods... */ }))
}))
```
