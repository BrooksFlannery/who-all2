# Problem
Remaining TypeScript errors in socket-server.ts after implementing socket authentication fixes. These are non-blocking for functionality but should be cleaned up.

# Affected Systems
- lib/socket-server.ts
- TypeScript compilation

# Root Cause
1. Line 305: `socket.userImage` type mismatch - `string | null` vs `string | undefined`
2. Line 407: `setTimeout` return type - `number` vs `NodeJS.Timeout`

# Solution
1. Fix `socket.userImage` type by ensuring it's always `string | undefined` instead of `string | null`
2. Fix `setTimeout` return type by using proper Node.js types or casting

# Debugging Process
1. Implemented socket authentication fixes with expert recommendations
2. Fixed most TypeScript errors related to null safety
3. Remaining errors are minor type mismatches that don't affect functionality
4. Core authentication logic is working correctly
5. All tests are passing
