# Problem
The `weightedInterests` field is defined as `text` in the database schema and is being stored as a string, but the database query is returning it as an object instead of a string. This causes the test `should have meaningful interest summaries` to fail with the error "expected 'object' to be 'string'".

# Affected Systems
- Database schema (lib/db/schema.ts)
- Database connection test (tests/test-database-connection.test.ts)
- User data retrieval and storage

# Root Cause
The issue appears to be that the database driver is automatically parsing the `weighted_interests` field as JSON when it should be treated as a plain text string. This could be due to:
1. The field containing JSON-like content that the driver is auto-parsing
2. A configuration issue with the database driver
3. The field being stored as JSONB instead of TEXT in the actual database

# Solution
1. Verify the actual database column type for `weighted_interests`
2. Ensure the field is being stored and retrieved as TEXT, not JSONB
3. Update the test to handle the actual data type being returned
4. Consider using explicit type casting in the query if needed

# Debugging Process
1. Identified the failing test in test-database-connection.test.ts
2. Found that the test expects `weightedInterests` to be a string but receives an object
3. Checked the schema definition which shows it should be TEXT
4. Verified the migration file shows the correct column type
5. Found that the data is being stored as a string in the embeddings.ts file
6. The issue is likely in the database driver's automatic JSON parsing
