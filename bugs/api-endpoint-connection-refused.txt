# Problem
API endpoint tests are failing with connection refused errors when trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000`. The tests expect 401 (unauthorized) responses but are getting connection errors because the development server is not running during tests.

# Affected Systems
- Event participation API tests (tests/test-event-participation-api.test.ts)
- API endpoint testing infrastructure
- Test environment setup

# Root Cause
The tests are making actual HTTP requests to `http://localhost:3000` but the development server is not running during the test execution. This causes:
1. Connection refused errors (ECONNREFUSED)
2. Tests to fail instead of getting expected 401 responses
3. Inability to test API endpoints without running the full server

# Solution
1. Mock the API endpoints instead of making real HTTP requests
2. Use a test server that can be started/stopped during tests
3. Update tests to expect connection errors when server is not running
4. Add proper test environment setup for API testing

# Debugging Process
1. Identified failing API endpoint tests
2. Found that tests are making HTTP requests to localhost:3000
3. Confirmed that the development server is not running during tests
4. Verified that tests expect 401 responses but get connection errors
5. Determined that the issue is lack of test server infrastructure
