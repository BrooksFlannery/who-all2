# Problem
The seed user ID update script fails with foreign key constraint violations when trying to update user IDs from "user-" to "seed-" prefix. The script attempts to update user IDs before updating the related foreign key references in the message, eventParticipation, and eventMessage tables.

# Affected Systems
- scripts/update-seed-user-ids.ts
- Database foreign key constraints between user table and related tables
- Tests/test-seed-user-updates.test.ts

# Root Cause
The update script tries to update user IDs directly, but PostgreSQL foreign key constraints prevent updating a primary key when it's referenced by foreign keys in other tables. The script needs to update the foreign key references first, then update the user IDs.

# Solution
Modify the update script to:
1. First update all foreign key references (message.userId, eventParticipation.userId, eventMessage.userId)
2. Then update the user IDs
3. Use a transaction to ensure atomicity

# Debugging Process
1. Identified foreign key constraint error: "update or delete on table "user" violates foreign key constraint"
2. Found that the script was trying to update user IDs before updating related foreign key references
3. The error occurs because PostgreSQL prevents updating primary keys that are referenced by foreign keys
4. Need to reverse the order: update foreign keys first, then primary keys
