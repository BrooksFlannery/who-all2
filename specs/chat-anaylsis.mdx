# Chat Analysis & Event Matching - Technical Specification

## Overview
Enhance the AI chat interface to intelligently match users with relevant events based on their interests and conversation context. The system will extract user preferences, match them against event keywords using semantic search, and present personalized event recommendations in the chat interface.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Events Table Enhancement
```sql
-- Add keywords field to existing event table
ALTER TABLE event ADD COLUMN keywords TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE event ADD COLUMN keyword_scores JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
```

#### User Profile Enhancement
```sql
-- Add interests field to existing user_profile table
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN interests JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN interest_scores JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE user_profile ADD COLUMN last_interest_update TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW();
```

#### New Table: Event Recommendations
```sql
-- Track which events have been recommended to users
CREATE TABLE event_recommendation (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    event_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES event(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    recommended_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    context TEXT, -- Store the conversation context that triggered this recommendation
    UNIQUE(user_id, event_id)
);
```

### 2. Data Structure Definitions

#### User Interests Format
```typescript
interface UserInterests {
  broad: string[];        // e.g., ["fitness", "social", "technology"]
  specific: string[];     // e.g., ["morning running", "coffee networking", "coding workshops"]
  scores: Record<string, number>; // Confidence scores 0-1
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

#### Event Keywords Format
```typescript
interface EventKeywords {
  keywords: string[];     // e.g., ["running", "fitness", "morning", "cardio", "outdoor"]
  scores: Record<string, number>; // Relevance scores 0-1
}
```

### 3. Implementation Components

#### A. Keyword Generation Script
**File**: `scripts/generate-event-keywords.ts`

**Purpose**: Extract keywords from existing events using AI
**Process**:
1. Fetch all events from database
2. Send event title + description to OpenAI
3. Request structured keyword extraction with relevance scores
4. Update database with keywords and scores

**AI Prompt**:
```
Extract relevant keywords from this event that would help match it to user interests.
Return as JSON: {
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...],
  "scores": {"keyword1": 0.9, "keyword2": 0.7, ...}
}

Event: {title} - {description}
```

#### B. Enhanced Chat API
**File**: `app/api/chat/[...all]+api.ts`

**New Flow**:
1. Receive user message
2. Check if user has recent interests (within 24h)
3. If not, or if new information detected, run interest extraction
4. Perform semantic matching against events
5. Generate response with events (if relevant)
6. Update user interests and recommendation history

#### C. Interest Extraction Service
**File**: `lib/services/interest-extraction.ts`

**Purpose**: Extract and update user interests from conversation
**Features**:
- Analyze current message + recent context
- Update existing interests or add new ones
- Maintain confidence scores
- Handle interest conflicts/updates

#### D. Event Matching Service
**File**: `lib/services/event-matching.ts`

**Purpose**: Match user interests to events using AI-powered semantic similarity
**Algorithm**:
1. Use AI to calculate similarity scores between user interests and event keywords
2. Apply popularity weighting (attendees + interested)
3. Filter out previously recommended events
4. Return ranked results with similarity scores

**Similarity Calculation**:
```typescript
// For each user interest vs event keyword combination
const similarityPrompt = `
Rate the similarity between these interests (0-1):
User Interest: "${userInterest}"
Event Keywords: ${eventKeywords.join(', ')}

Consider related activities, synonyms, and broader categories.
Return only a number between 0 and 1.
`;
```

#### E. Chat UI Enhancement
**File**: `components/EventCard.tsx` (new reusable component)
**File**: `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` (enhanced)

**Features**:
- Extract event card rendering logic from events page
- Support for inline event cards in chat
- Maintain identical styling to main events page

### 4. AI System Prompts

#### Interest Extraction Prompt
```
You are a helpful assistant analyzing user conversations to understand their interests and preferences for events.

Extract interests from this message and conversation context. Return as JSON:
{
  "newInterests": {
    "broad": ["category1", "category2"],
    "specific": ["specific_interest1", "specific_interest2"]
  },
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "shouldUpdate": true/false
}

Consider:
- Categories: fitness, social, creative, technology, education, food, music, outdoors, business
- Activity levels: beginner, intermediate, advanced
- Skill requirements: none, some experience, expert level
- Social preferences: group activities, solo activities, networking

Message: {userMessage}
Recent Context: {recentMessages}
```

#### Event Recommendation Prompt
```
You are a friendly event recommendation assistant. You know about all local events and want to help users find activities they'll enjoy.

When recommending events:
- Be conversational and enthusiastic
- Ask clarifying questions if too many events match (continue until you have 3 or fewer clear matches)
- Focus on category, activity level, and skill requirements
- Don't mention time/location (handled separately)
- Limit to 3 events maximum

If you have good matches, include them in your response like this:
<events>
[{"id": "event_id", "title": "Event Title", "description": "Description", "categories": ["category1"], "attendeesCount": 5, "interestedCount": 3, "location": {"neighborhood": "Area"}}]
</events>

If you don't have enough information about the user's interests, tell them you need to learn more about what they enjoy.

User Interests: {userInterests}
Available Events: {matchedEvents}
```

## 🚨 Current Issues & Next Steps

### Issue 1: JSON Parsing Error in Interest Extraction
**Problem**: AI returns markdown-formatted JSON (````json`) instead of raw JSON
**Error**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '`', "```json`

**Solution**: Improve the AI prompt to be more explicit about JSON formatting:
```typescript
const prompt = `
Extract interests from this message and conversation context. 

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text.

Expected format:
{"newInterests": {"broad": [], "specific": []}, "confidence": 0.8, "shouldUpdate": true}

Message: ${userMessage}
Recent Context: ${context}

Return only the JSON object:`;
```

### Issue 2: Missing User Profile Creation
**Problem**: Existing users don't have associated user profiles
**Impact**: Interest extraction fails because no profile exists to store interests

**Solution**: Add automatic profile creation in chat API:
```typescript
// After getting user profile
if (!userProfile) {
  // Create default profile for existing user
  await eventService.createUserProfile(session.user.id, {
    name: session.user.name,
    location: { lat: 0, lng: 0 }, // Default location
    interests: [],
    preferences: { distance_radius_km: 10, preferred_categories: [] }
  });
}
```

### Issue 3: Event Matching Query Issue
**Problem**: Event matching service queries for events with empty keywords array
**Impact**: No events are found for matching

**Solution**: Fix the query in event matching service:
```typescript
// Change from:
const events = await db.select().from(event).where(eq(event.keywords, []));

// To:
const events = await db.select().from(event).where(sql`array_length(${event.keywords}, 1) > 0`);
```
