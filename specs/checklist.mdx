# Implementation Checklist: Chat Event Recommendations Feature

## 🎯 **Goal: Display event recommendations as cards inline in chat messages**

### **Current State:**
- ✅ Interest extraction working
- ✅ Event recommendation scoring working
- ✅ AI tool calls functioning
- ❌ Events returned as text instead of data
- ❌ No event cards displayed in chat
- ❌ AI provides generic responses instead of flavor text

### **Target State:**
- ✅ `getRecommendations` tool returns full event objects
- ✅ Chat displays event cards inline with AI responses
- ✅ AI provides conversational flavor text about events
- ✅ Event cards match Events screen format
- ✅ Proper error handling and fallbacks

- [ ] Test type definitions compile correctly

### **2.2 Create Event Card Component for Chat**
- [ ] Extract `EventCard` component from `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` to shared location
- [ ] Create `components/EventCard.tsx` with reusable component
- [ ] Add optional `compact` prop for chat context
- [ ] Ensure component matches Events screen styling
- [ ] Test component renders correctly with event data

### **2.3 Update Chat Message Rendering**
- [ ] Modify chat message rendering in `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`
- [ ] Add conditional rendering for events in assistant messages
- [ ] Implement `renderAssistantMessage` function with event cards
- [ ] Add proper styling for events container
- [ ] Test event cards display inline with AI responses

### **2.4 Add Chat-Specific Styling**
- [ ] Create `styles.eventsContainer` for chat context
- [ ] Adjust event card margins and padding for chat
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing between AI text and event cards
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Verify styling matches design requirements

## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

### **Key Decisions**
- Return full event objects from tools (not IDs)
- Display events inline with AI responses
- Reuse Events screen card component
- Provide conversational flavor text from AI
- Always return top 3 events regardless of match quality

### **Dependencies**
- Existing Events screen components
- Current chat infrastructure
- Database event schema
- Embedding calculation system

### **Files to Modify**
- `lib/chat-analysis/recommendation-engine.ts` - Update return format
- `app/api/chat/[...all]+api.ts` - Handle new tool responses
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` - Add event card rendering
- `components/EventCard.tsx` - Create reusable component
- Type definitions for chat messages

### **Files to Create**
- `components/EventCard.tsx` - Reusable event card component
- Event validation utilities
- Chat-specific styling
