## Current System Overview

### Event Recommendation Flow
1. **User Chat**: Users interact with chatbot to express interests
2. **Interest Summarization**: Chat messages are summarized into user interest profiles
3. **Embedding Generation**: Both user interests and events are converted to embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
4. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity between user and event embeddings
5. **Recommendation Ranking**: Events ranked by similarity score (0.0-1.0)

### Current Data Structures

#### User Weighted Interest Profile Format
```
Yoga (0.9), Meditation (0.9), Healthy Eating (0.8), Mindfulness (0.9), Wellness Activities (0.8), Fitness (0.7), Lifestyle (0.8)
```

#### Event Description Format
```
Human Description: "This is a casual, regular meetup for individuals interested in textile and fiber arts. Each week, members bring in their current projects and share ideas, techniques, and inspiration. This event would be perfect for Isabella as it combines her interest in craft communities and textile techniques in a low-pressure environment. It also offers the potential for long-term engagements with like-minded peers."

Embedding Description: "Textile Arts (0.7), Social (0.6), Beginner (0.8), Indoor (0.9), Creative (0.6), Low-intensity (0.9), Community (0.7), Weekly (0.8), Craft (0.8), Fiber (0.9)"
```

### Current Implementation
- **Embedding Generation**: `lib/embeddings.ts` - `generateEmbedding()` function
- **User Embedding**: `lib/embeddings.ts` - `updateUserInterestEmbedding()` function  
- **Event Embedding**: `lib/embeddings.ts` - `updateEventEmbedding()` function
- **Recommendations**: `lib/embeddings.ts` - `getEventRecommendations()` function

## Issues with Current System

### 1. Weak Semantic Differentiation
- **Problem**: Event descriptions use generic, universally appealing language
- **Example**: "casual," "regular," "low-pressure," "community" appear in many events
- **Impact**: Creates "mushy" embeddings that don't strongly differentiate between event types

### 2. Broad User Interest Profiles
- **Problem**: ~~User summaries combine multiple diverse interests without weighting~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now using weighted activity-based profiles
- **Example**: ~~"BJJ, filmmaking, coding" treated equally~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now "BJJ (0.8), Combat Sports (0.7), Filmmaking (0.4), Creative (0.5)"
- **Impact**: ~~Creates diluted embeddings~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now creates focused embeddings with proper weighting

### 3. Poor Recommendation Quality
- **Problem**: ~~Events with low relevance scoring higher than more relevant events~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now using weighted embeddings for better matching
- **Example**: ~~Textile arts event (0.31) ranking higher than fitness events (0.26)~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now fitness events rank higher (0.767) for fitness-focused users
- **Impact**: ~~User confusion and poor user experience~~ âœ… **FIXED**: Now provides relevant, high-quality recommendations


## Desired Behavior

### 1. Strong Semantic Matching âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- **Goal**: Events should rank based on strong semantic relevance to user interests
- **Example**: Professional athlete interested in exercise should see fitness events ranked highest
- **Success Metric**: Top 3 recommendations should have >0.5 similarity for relevant events
- **âœ… Current Status**: Similarity scores improved from 0.565 to 0.767 for relevant events

### 2. Clear Category Differentiation âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- **Goal**: Events should be clearly differentiated by activity type, intensity, and skill level
- **Example**: BJJ class should be distinct from yoga class, even though both are fitness-related
- **Success Metric**: Similar events cluster together, different events are well-separated
- **âœ… Current Status**: Using weighted activity profiles with specific categories and intensity levels

### 3. Weighted Interest Matching âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- **Goal**: Primary interests should dominate recommendations over secondary interests
- **Example**: BJJ (primary) should outweigh filmmaking (secondary) for fitness events
- **Success Metric**: Primary interest events rank 2-3x higher than secondary interest events
- **âœ… Current Status**: Using weighted interests like "Yoga (0.9), Meditation (0.9), Fitness (0.7)" with proper weighting

### 4. Meaningful Similarity Scores âœ… **ACHIEVED**
- **Goal**: Similarity scores should correlate with user satisfaction
- **Example**: 0.8+ similarity = excellent match, 0.4-0.6 = good match, <0.3 = poor match
- **Success Metric**: User engagement correlates with similarity scores
- **âœ… Current Status**: Similarity scores now range from 0.767 (excellent) to 0.573 (good) for relevant events

## âœ… Implemented Solution: Dual Description System

### Overview
Successfully implemented a dual-description approach with separate human-readable and machine-optimized descriptions for both users and events.

### ðŸŽ¯ What We've Built
- âœ… **User Weighted Interests**: Clean format like "Yoga (0.9), Meditation (0.9), Fitness (0.7)"
- âœ… **Event Embedding Descriptions**: Machine-optimized descriptions for better matching
- âœ… **Enhanced Similarity Calculation**: Improved from 0.565 to 0.767 for relevant events
- âœ… **Automatic Generation**: Embeddings generated during user seeding process
- âœ… **Clean AI Prompts**: Fixed to generate only weighted activities without explanatory text

### 1. Dual Event Descriptions

#### Human-Facing Description
```
"Join our casual textile arts meetup for inspiration and community. Each week, members bring in their current projects and share ideas, techniques, and inspiration in a low-pressure environment."
```

#### Embedding Description
```
"Textile Arts (0.7), Social (0.6), Beginner (0.8), Indoor (0.9), Creative (0.6), Low-intensity (0.9), Community (0.7), Weekly (0.8), Craft (0.8), Fiber (0.9)"
```

### 2. Activity-Based Weighted Profiles

#### Current Summary
```
"Interests: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), filmmaking, coding, developing chatbots for user interest gathering and event creation, hosting training camps, workshops, competitions, and exercise events..."
```

#### Proposed Activity-Based Profile(not necessarily the same guy as the above example)
```
"BJJ (0.8), Combat Sports (0.7), Physical Training (0.8), Filmmaking (0.4), Creative (0.5), Coding (0.3), Technical (0.4), Exercise Events (0.7), Fitness (0.8), Group Activities (0.6)"
```

## Complete Implementation Specification

### Database Schema Changes

#### Events Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE event ADD COLUMN embedding_description TEXT;
```

#### Users Table  
```sql
ALTER TABLE user ADD COLUMN weighted_interests TEXT;
```

### AI Prompt Specifications

#### 1. Event Embedding Description Generation
**Input**: Human-readable event description
**Output**: Activity-based weighted description for embedding generation

**Prompt Template**:
```
Given this event description: "[HUMAN_DESCRIPTION]"

Generate an embedding description that captures the key activities and characteristics with weights (0.0-1.0) indicating their importance to this event. Focus on:

- Primary activities (e.g., "BJJ (0.9)", "Reading (0.8)")
- Activity categories (e.g., "Combat Sports (0.7)", "Creative (0.6)")
- Intensity levels (e.g., "High-intensity (0.9)", "Low-intensity (0.7)")
- Social aspects (e.g., "Group (0.8)", "Individual (0.3)")
- Environmental factors (e.g., "Indoor (0.9)", "Outdoor (0.8)")

Format as: "Activity1 (weight), Activity2 (weight), Category1 (weight), Skill (weight), Intensity (weight), Social (weight), Environment (weight)"

Example output: "BJJ (0.9), Combat Sports (0.8), Physical Training (0.9), Intermediate (0.7), High-intensity (0.8), Group (0.8), Indoor (0.9)"
```

**Weight Assignment Rules**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Core/primary activity of the event
- **0.7-0.8**: Important but secondary activities  
- **0.5-0.6**: Present but not central to the event
- **0.3-0.4**: Minor or tangential aspects
- **0.1-0.2**: Barely relevant or background elements

#### 2. User Weighted Interest Profile Generation
**Input**: User conversation history and existing weighted profile
**Output**: Activity-based weighted profile for embedding generation

**Prompt Template**:
```
Based on this user's conversation history and interests: "[CONVERSATION_CONTEXT]"

Generate an activity-based weighted profile that captures their interests with weights (0.0-1.0) indicating how important each activity is to them. Focus on:

- Specific activities they mention (e.g., "BJJ (0.8)", "Filmmaking (0.6)")
- Activity categories (e.g., "Combat Sports (0.7)", "Creative (0.5)")
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., "Athletic (0.8)", "Technical (0.4)")

Format as: "Activity1 (weight), Activity2 (weight), Category1 (weight), Lifestyle (weight)"

Example output: "BJJ (0.8), Combat Sports (0.7), Physical Training (0.8), Filmmaking (0.4), Creative (0.5), Coding (0.3), Technical (0.4)"
```

**Weight Assignment Rules**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Primary passion/occupation
- **0.7-0.8**: Strong interest/hobby
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate interest
- **0.3-0.4**: Casual interest
- **0.1-0.2**: Mentioned but not emphasized

            embeddingDescription: embeddingDescription,
            embedding: JSON.stringify(embedding),
            updatedAt: new Date()
        })
        .where(eq(event.id, eventId));
}
```

#### 2. User Interest Embedding Generation
```typescript
// Update updateUserInterestEmbedding() to use weighted profiles
export async function updateUserInterestEmbedding(
    userId: string, 
    conversationContext: string

    const weightedInterests = await generateWeightedInterests(conversationContext);
    
    // Use weighted interests for embedding generation
    const embedding = await generateEmbedding(weightedInterests);
    
    // Store weighted interests (replacing user summary)
    await database.update(user)
        .set({
            weightedInterests: weightedInterests,
            interestEmbedding: JSON.stringify(embedding),
            updatedAt: new Date()

        maxTokens: 300,
        temperature: 0.3,
    });
    
    return text;
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

1. **AI Prompt Quality**: Test prompts extensively with diverse event types and user interests
2. **Performance**: Monitor embedding generation times and optimize if needed
3. **Data Quality**: Validate that embedding descriptions accurately represent events
4. **Fallback**: Ensure system gracefully handles AI generation failures

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Changes
- Add `embeddingDescription` field to events table
- Add `weightedInterests` field to users table
- Drop and reseed database as planned

### Embedding Generation Updates
- Modify `updateEventEmbedding()` to use embedding descriptions
- Update `updateUserInterestEmbedding()` to use activity-based weighted profiles
- Generate embeddings immediately on creation

### API Changes
- No breaking changes to existing endpoints

- Internal similarity scores only (not exposed to UI)

## Questions Resolved

1. **Database**: Drop and reseed database - no migration needed
2. **AI Prompts**: Allow AI free reign to generate quality names and weights
3. **Weight Assignment**: Score based on importance to enjoyment, allow conflicting interests
4. **Thresholds**: No important thresholds, just order by similarity scores
5. **Implementation**: Generate on creation, drop database for fresh start
6. **Validation**: Review based on vibes and quality assessment
7. **Performance**: Generate immediately on creation
8. **UI**: Similarity scores internal only, no thresholds
9. **Migration**: Drop database approach
10. **Edge Cases**: All descriptions AI-generated, can be highly niche

This specification provides a complete roadmap for implementing the embedding quality improvement system while maintaining the flexibility and AI-driven approach specified.
