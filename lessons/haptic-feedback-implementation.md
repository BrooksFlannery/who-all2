# Haptic Feedback Implementation

## Problem
The specification required adding haptic feedback to JoinButton presses and message sending to improve the user experience. The project already had `expo-haptics` installed but it wasn't being used.

## Solution
1. **Import expo-haptics**: Added the import to both JoinButton and ChatSection components
2. **JoinButton haptic feedback**: Added `Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium)` to the handlePress function
3. **Message sending haptic feedback**: Added `Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)` to the handleSend function
4. **Fixed TypeScript issues**: Resolved useRef initialization issue in ChatSection component
5. **Created tests**: Added test file to verify haptic feedback functionality

## Files Modified
- `components/event/JoinButton.tsx` - Added haptic feedback import and implementation
- `components/event/ChatSection.tsx` - Added haptic feedback import and implementation, fixed useRef initialization
- `tests/test-join-button.test.ts` - Created test file for haptic feedback functionality
- `specs/event-page.mdx` - Updated checklist to mark haptic feedback items as complete

## Key Learnings
- Use `ImpactFeedbackStyle.Medium` for button presses (stronger feedback)
- Use `ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light` for message sending (subtle feedback)
- Always provide initial value for useRef to avoid TypeScript errors
- Test haptic feedback functionality with mocked expo-haptics
