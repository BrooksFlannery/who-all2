# Network Condition Testing

**Problem:**
The specification required tests for various network conditions (slow, offline, intermittent, high latency, bandwidth constraints) to ensure robust error handling and user experience. The existing tests did not cover all these scenarios, and some test logic was initially incorrect due to endpoint matching order and timer precision.

**Solution:**
- Created `tests/test-network-conditions.test.ts` to simulate slow, offline, intermittent, high-latency, and bandwidth-constrained network conditions using Vitest and fetch mocking.
- Fixed endpoint matching in the mock implementation to ensure specific endpoints are checked before general ones.
- Allowed a small margin of error in latency assertions to account for timer inaccuracy.
- Ensured all tests pass and accurately reflect real-world network issues.

**File(s):**
- `tests/test-network-conditions.test.ts`
- `specs/event-page.mdx` (checklist update)
