# Skeleton Loading Implementation

## Problem
The specification required adding loading skeletons for event loading to improve the user experience by showing visual placeholders instead of just a spinner.

## Solution
1. **Created Skeleton component**: Built a reusable `Skeleton` component in `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` using `LinearGradient` for a shimmer effect
2. **Integrated into EventPage**: Replaced the simple `ActivityIndicator` loading state with skeleton placeholders for:
   - Event header (photo area)
   - Event title
   - Date/time
   - Venue information
   - Categories
   - Description
   - Participant avatars
   - Join buttons
3. **Added testID support**: Enhanced the Skeleton component with testID prop for future testing

## Files Modified
- `components/ui/Skeleton.tsx` - Created reusable skeleton component
- `components/event/EventPage.tsx` - Integrated skeleton placeholders in loading state
- `tests/test-event-page-skeleton.test.ts` - Attempted test (see challenges below)
- `tests/test-skeleton.test.ts` - Simple component test (see challenges below)

## Key Learnings
- Use `LinearGradient` with alternating colors for shimmer effect
- Skeleton placeholders should match the actual content layout
- TestID props are essential for reliable component testing
- React Native component testing requires specific environment setup

## Challenges Encountered
1. **Testing Environment**: The Vitest configuration uses 'node' environment, but React Native components require a different setup
2. **Dependency Conflicts**: `@testing-library/react-native` has peer dependency conflicts with React 19
3. **JSX Parsing**: The test runner has issues parsing JSX in React Native components

## Testing Status
- ✅ Skeleton component is implemented and functional
- ❌ Unit tests for skeleton rendering are blocked by test environment configuration
- ✅ Manual testing confirms skeletons render correctly during event loading

## Future Improvements
- Configure Vitest for React Native testing environment
- Add animation to skeleton shimmer effect
- Create more granular skeleton components for different content types
